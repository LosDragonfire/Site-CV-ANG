                    My name is Jules TOUPIN, and I am currently in the 4th year of engineering school at 
                    INSA Centre Val de Loire, specializing in Industrial Systems Engineering. I am 
                    relatively versatile, but I have a preference for electronics, computer science, 
                    automation, and signal processing.
                </p>
                <br>

                    the fields of automation, signal processing, and embedded systems.
